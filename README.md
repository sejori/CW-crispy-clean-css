# Crispy Clean CSS

It’s time to put your CSS fingers to the test with a real, modern UI!

Before you start coding, complete this quick [tutorial on flexbox](https://flexboxfroggy.com/).

Then check out this excellent jumpstart on [common layouts using grids](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Realizing_common_layouts_using_CSS_Grid_Layout) from MDN.

Now we're going to use Flexbox and Grid, along with many other nifty CSS features, to make a crispy clean web interface for the imaginary cleaning business Crispy Clean Ltd. It's got to be eye-catching, professional, responsive and most importantly, crispy clean.

The image below shows the design you will be recreating. Content is contrained within containers and the main content in the page is arranged in a typical 12-column grid. On mobile the grid is replaced by a flex column, the nav links become hidden by a hamburger menu and some of the page sections wrap in order to flow nicely vertically.

The web page is made up of 6 sections from top to bottom:
- Navigation Bar
- Hero (showcase) section
- Client testimonials
- FAQs
- Email contact form
- Footer

### Objectives

To complete this exercise make sure you achieve the following objectives:

- Recreate the design spec using vanilla CSS, not a CSS framework.
- Recreate the desktop layout using CSS `grid` display property.
- Enhance the layout using CSS `@media` queries and `flex` to make it responsive.
- Recreate the responsive page sections and correctly position them within the layout.
- Make your CSS modular and DRY (i.e. use CSS variables and imports).
- Make your UX smooth and nice to interact with by using CSS animations.
